# 2.2 Cellular Respiration
```ad-de
Cellular respiration is a series of enzyme controlled reactions in which a respiration substrate such as glucose is broken down to generate energy in the form of ATP
```
There are 3 main pathways in cellular respiration:
- glycolysis
- citric acid cycle
- electron trasnport chain
## Glycolysis
Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate and occurs in the **cytoplasm**.  Two ATP molecules are required in the energy investment phase for the phosphorylation of glucose in glycolysis. Then, this leads to the generation of more ATP during the energy pay-off stage resulting in a net gain of ATP. 
Each glucose molecule is broken down into 2 pyruvate.

Gylcolysis: cytoplasm, net 2 ATP produced, does not require oxygen

## Fermentation
In the absence of oxygen,  pyruvate undergoes fermentation in the cytoplasm of the cell.
In animal cells, pyruvate is converted to lactate in a reversible reaction. In plants and yeast, ethanol and carbon dioxide are produced in an **irreversible** reaction.  
Fermentation results in much less ATP being produced than in aerobic respiration (2 molecules as opposed to 38).
$$pyruvate\longleftrightarrow lactate$$
$$pyruvate\longrightarrow ethanol+CO_{2}$$
## Citric Acid Cycle
The aerobic stage of cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondrial matrix. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is broken down into an **acetyl group** that combines with **coenzyme A** to form **Acetyl CoA**. NADH and carbon dioxide are also formed in this process.
In the citric acid cycle, the acetyl group combines with **oxaloacetate** to form **citrate**. During a series of enzyme controlled reactions, citrate is converted back into oxaloacetate which results in the **generation of ATP** and **release of carbon dioxide**.

## Electron Transport Chain
The electron transport chain is a series of carrier proteins attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae). 
Electrons are passed along the Electron Transport Chain releasing energy. This energy allows Hydrogen ions to be pumped across the inner mitochondrial   membrane.   The flow of these ions back through the membrane protein ATP Synthase, resulting in the production of ATP.
The elctron transport chain produces the most ATP in cellular respiration.
 ```ad-key
 Oxygen is the final acceptor of electrons and combines with hydrogen ions and electrons to form water. FADH and NADH can trasnport hydrogen to the electron trasnport chain

## Role of ATP
ATP is used to transfer energy to cellular processes which require energy.
Examples:
-   Nerve transmission
-   Muscle contraction
-   Active transport.
