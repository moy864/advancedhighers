# Environmental Control of Metabolism
Microorganisms include:
- bacteria
- archaea
- some eukaryotes
 ```ad-key
 Micro-organisms use a wide variety of substrates for metabolism and produce a **wide range of products** from their metabolic pathways
 ```
 ## Variation in Growth Media and Control of Environmental Factors
 When culturing micro-organisms, their growth media requires raw materials for **biosynthesis** as well as an **energy source**.
 Many microorganisms produce all the complex molecules required for biosynthesis eg amino acids, fatty acids and vitamins. However, other microorganisms rewquire for these to be provided in the growth media. Growth media may contain simple substrates suitable for specific microorganisms or more complex ingredients like beef ectract.  
An energy source is derived either from chemical substrates such as carbohydrates or from light in the case of photosynthetic micro-organisms.
 
 ## Growth Phases
 - Lag: **enzymes are induced** to metabolise substrates
 - Log/exponential: contains the most rapid growth of microorganisms due to a **plentiful supply of nutrients**
 - Stationary:  This phase occurs due to the **nutrients in the culture media becoming depleted** and the production of toxic metabolites. **Secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics**, are also produced. In the wild these metabolites confer an ecological ad- vantage by allowing the micro-organisms which produce them to outcompete other micro-organisms.
 - Death: occurs due to the **toxic accumulation of metabolites** or the **lack of nutrients **in culture

Semi-logarithmic scales can be used to show the exponential growth phase of micro- organisms. Use of semi-logarithmic graphs to plot the exponential growth phase, produces a straight line.

 An industrial fermentor can be used to culture microorganisms on a large scale. Sensors are used to monitor oxygen levels, temperature and pH.

 ## Viable and Total Cell Count
 **Total cell count** involves counting both viable and dead cells. Whereas **viable cell count** only includes the living micro-organisms. Therefore only viable cell count shows a death phase
