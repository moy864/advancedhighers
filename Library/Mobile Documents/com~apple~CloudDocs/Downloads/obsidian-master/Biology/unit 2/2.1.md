# 2.1 Metabolic Pathways
```ad-de
Metabolic Pathways- integrated and controlled pathways of enzyme catalysed reaction within a cell. They can have reversible and irreversible steps as well as alternative routes
```

There are two main types of reaction in metabolic pathways:
```ad-an
| Anabolic                                                    | Catabolic      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Require energy                                              | Release energy |
| **Building up** of large, complex mulecules from small molcules | **Breaking down** of large, complezx molecules intro smaller ones               |
```

## Membranes
Membranes consist of **phospholipids and proteins**. The phospholipids create a bilayer and are constantly moving thus giving the membrane flexibility. 
Proteins embedded within membranes can be:
- pumps: control active transport eg the sodium potassium pump
- pores: control diffusion of small molecules across the cell membrane
- enzymes eg ATP synthase

```ad-key
Metabolic pathways are controlled by the absence or presence of key enzymes and the regulation of the rate of reaction of these enzymes.

## Activation Energy
The energy required to initiate a chemical reaction is known as the activation energy. Enzymes lower the activation energy required for a reaction to take place.

## Affinity
The activity of enzymes depends on their flexible and dynamic shape.  **Substrate molecules have high affinity** for the active site of an enzyme (bind readily). Whereas, **products have a low affinity** for the active site of an enzyme, allowing them to leave the active site.

``` ad-key 
The enzyme is flexible and the substrate can induce the active site to change shape to better fit the substrate after the substrate binds forming the ES complex. This is known as **induced fit**
```

## Direction of enzyme-controlled reactions  
Some metabolic reactions are reversible and the presence of a substrate or the removal of a product will drive a sequence of reactions in a particular direction.

## Effect of Substrate and Enzyme Concentration
As the concentration of Substrate or Enzyme increases, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reation increases since more active sites will be occupied by substrate and therefore more enzyme-substrate complexes will be formed. If however, either enzyme or substrate concentration is limited, the rate reaction will only increase up to a point. Beyond this point, the rate of reaction remains Constant because either active sites will remain unoccupied (if substrate concentration is limited) or substrate molecules will have no active sites to occupy (if enzyme concentration is limited).

## Enzyme Inhibition
```ad-de
An Inhibitor is a substance which reduces the rate of an enzyme controlled reaction.

```ad-in
| Competitive                                                   | Non-competitive                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bind at the active site preventing the substrate from binding | bind at an allosteric site (not the active site)                                                    |
| can be reversed through increasing substrate concentration    | irreversible because they change the shape of the active site preventing the substrate from binding |

#### Feedback Inhibition
Feed back inhibition occurs when the end-product in the metabolic pathway reaches a critical concentration. The end-product then inhibits an earlier enzyme, blocking the pathway and so prevents further synthesis of the end-product.
