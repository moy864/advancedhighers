# 2.7: Genetic Control of Metabolism

```ad-de
Mutagenesis- the exposing of microorganisms to UV light and other forms of radiation or mutagenic chemicals resulting in mutations

Vector- a DNA molecule used to carry foreign genetic information into another cell

## Improving Wild Strains 
Wild strains of micro-organisms can be improved through **mutagenesis or recombinant DNA technology**. Scientists may wish to change the DNA of wild strains to produce useful substances, or provide useful substances more efficiently.
New mutations are an important source of variation within populations of micro-organisms. For example, wild strains of micro-organisms can be changed and improved by the use of mutagenic agents.

## Mutagenesis 
The process of changing a micro-organismâ€™s genetic material using mutagenic agents is called mutagenesis.
There are two main types of mutagenic agents:
-   Radiation - eg UV light, X-rays and gamma rays
-   Chemical - eg mustard gas and lead oxide


## Recombinant DNA Technology
Recombinant DNA technology involves the use of:
-   Recombinant Plasmids
-   Artificial chromosomes
 Artificial chromosomes and plasmids are examples of vectors used in recombinant DNA technology.
 
 ```ad-key
Artificial chromosomes are preferable to plasmids as vectors when **larger fragments** of foreign DNA are required to be inserted.
```

**Restriction endonucleases** cut open plasmids and specific genes out of chromosomes leaving sticky ends.
Complimentary sticky ends are produced when the same restriction endonuclease is used to cut open the plasmid and the gene from the chromosome.

**Ligase** is the enzyme used to seal the gene into the plasmid.

Recombinant plasmids and artificial chromosomes contain restriction sites, regulatory sequences, an origin of replication and selectable markers.

- **Regulatory sequences** control gene expression.  
- **Origin of Replication** allows self-replication of the plasmid/artificial chromosome.
- **Selectable markers** such as antibiotic resistance genes protect the micro-organism from a selective agent (antibiotic) that would normally kill it or prevent it growing.

```ad-key

Selectable marker genes present in the vector ensure that only micro-organisms that have taken up the vector grow in the presence of the selective agent (antibiotic).
i.e  To identify bacterial cells which have taken up the recombinant plasmid, the cells are grown in a nutrient medium containing an antibiotic. Only bacterial cells which contain the recombinant plasmid survive ( due to the presence of the marker gene/antibiotic resistance gene). Bacterial cells which have not taken up the recombinant plasmid do not have resistance to the antibiotic and so are killed.
```

## Safety precautions  
As a safety mechanism, genes are often introduced that prevent the survival of the micro-organism in an external environment.

## Limitations of using Prokaryotes in Recombinant DNA technology
Plant or animal (eukaryotic) DNA expressed in bacteria (prokaryotes) may result in polypeptides being incorrectly folded (since they are not capable of post-translational modification).
**Recombinant Yeast Cells** (which are eukaryotic) may be used instead to produce active forms of the protein which are inactive in bacteria.
