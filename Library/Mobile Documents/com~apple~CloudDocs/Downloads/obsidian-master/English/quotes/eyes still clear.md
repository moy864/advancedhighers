[[Norman MacCaig]] [[Visiting Hour]]
 The [[Word choice]] of "eyes still clear" suggests that despite the difficult situations they face on a daily basis, they have become desensitised to death. Furthermore, this [[contrasts]] with the narrator's attitude in how he suffering in a difficult and hurtful personal situation. This therefore emphasises his admiration towards the nurses. 
 Just as the narrator [[I will not feel]] until he has to, so too do the hospital workers suppress their emotions
 
 ```ad-note
 - "of so much pain, so many deaths" 
 The [[repetition]] of "so" emphasises the extent of the burden the nurses carry and strengthens the contrast between the nurses and the poet. They cope so well "carrying their burden", yet the poet struggles with his feelings.
