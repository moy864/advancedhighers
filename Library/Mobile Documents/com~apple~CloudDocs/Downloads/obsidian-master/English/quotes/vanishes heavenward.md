[[Norman MacCaig]] [[Visiting Hour]]

- The [[enjambment]] of "vanishes/heavenward" 
- This is the first indication of what is on his mind. 
- When he sees a trolley bearing a body he immediately assumes it is a dead body. 

```ad-note
This is the first indication of what is on his mind. When he sees a trolley bearing a body he immediately assumes it is a dead body. "Vanishes heavenward" in fact it goes up in a lift, but as far as the poet is concerned, it is on its last journey. He is obviously worried about his sick relative-has he come too late? The ENJAMBMENT here places emphasis on the words "corpse" and "vanishes" which suggest his thoughs on death and its finality. Furthermore, this reinforces the hopeless tone of the poem.
