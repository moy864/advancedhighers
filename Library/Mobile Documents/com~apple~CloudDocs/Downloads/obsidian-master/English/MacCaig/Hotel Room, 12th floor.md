# Hotel Room, 12th Floor
[[This morning]] I watched from here  
[[a helicopter skirting like a damaged insect]]  
the Empire State Building, that  
[[jumbo size dentist’s drill]], and landing  
on the roof of the PanAm skyscraper.  
But now [[midnight has come]] in  
from [[foreign places]]. Its uncivilised darkness  
is shot at by a million lit windows, all  
[[ups and acrosses]]

But midnight is not  
[[so easily defeated]]. I lie in bed, between  
[[a radio and a television set, and hear]]  
the [[wildest of warwhoops]] continually ululating through  
the [[glittering canyons and gulches]]—  
police cars and ambulances racing  
to the [[broken bones]], the harsh screaming  
from [[coldwater flats]], the blood  
[[glazed on sidewalks.]]

The [[frontier]] is [[never]]  
[[somewhere else]]. And no [[stockades]]  
can keep the midnight out.
