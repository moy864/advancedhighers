# Aunt Julia
Aunt Julia spoke Gaelic  
[[very loud and very fast]].  
[[I could not answer her — ]]
I could not understand her.

She [[wore men’s boots]]  
when she wore any.  
— [[I can see]] her strong foot,  
[[stained with peat,]]  
[[paddling with the treadle]] of the spinningwheel  
while her right hand drew yarn  
[[marvellously]] out of the air.

Hers was the [[only house]]  
where I’ve lain at night  
in the [[absolute darkness]] 
of a [[box bed]], listening to  
[[crickets being friendly]].

[[She was buckets]]  
and water [[flouncing]] into them.  
She was [[winds pouring wetly]]  
round house-ends.  
She was brown eggs, black skirts  
and a keeper of threepennybits  
in a teapot.

[[Aunt Julia spoke Gaelic]]  
very loud and very fast.  
By the time I had learned  
[[a little, she lay]]  
[[silenced]] in the absolute black  
of a [[sandy grave]]  
at Luskentyre. [[But I hear her still,]] welcoming me  
with a [[seagull’s voice]]  
across a hundred yards  
of peatscrapes and lazybeds  
and [[getting angry, getting angry]]  
[[with so many questions]]  
[[unanswered]].
