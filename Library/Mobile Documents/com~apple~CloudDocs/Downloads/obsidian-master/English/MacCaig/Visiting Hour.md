# Visiting Hour
[[The hospital smell]]
[[combs my nostrils]]  
as they [[go bobbing along]]
[[green and yellow corridors]]

[[what seems a corpse]]
is [[trundled]] into a lift and [[vanishes heavenward]] (line break: vanishes/heavenward)

[[I will not feel]], I will not  
feel, until  
I have to.

Nurses walk [[lightly, swiftly]],  
[[here and up and down and there]],  
their slender waists [[miraculously]]  
carrying their burden   
of so much pain, so  
many deaths, their [[eyes still clear]]  (line break: eyes/)
still clear after  
[[so many farewells]].

[[Ward 7.]]She lies  
in a [[White cave]] of forgetfulness.  
A [[Withered hand]] 
[[trembles on its stalk]]. [[eyes move]] 
[[behind eyelids too heavy]] 
to raise. Into an arm wasted  
of colour a [[glass fang is  fixed]],
not [[guzzling but giving]].  
And between her and me  
distance shrinks till there is none left  
[[but the distance of pain that neither she nor I]]
can cross.

She smiles a little at this  
[[black figure in her white cave]]
who [[clumsily]] rises  
[[in the round swimming waves of a bells]] 
and dizzily goes off, [[growing fainter]],  
not smaller, leaving behind only  
[[books that will not be read]]
and [[fruitless fruits]].
