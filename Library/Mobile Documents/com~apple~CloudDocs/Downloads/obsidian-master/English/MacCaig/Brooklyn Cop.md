# Brooklyn Cop
[[Built like a gorilla but less timid]],  
[[thick-fleshed, steak-coloured]], with two  
[[hieroglyphs in his face]] that mean  
trouble, he walks the sidewalk and the  
[[thin tissue over violence]]. This morning,  
when he said, [[‘See you, babe’]] to his wife,  
[[he hoped it, he truly hoped it]].  
[[He is a gorilla]]  
to whom [[‘Hiya, honey’ is no cliché]].

[[Should the tissue tear,]] should he [[plunge]] through  
into violence, what clubbings, what  
gunshots between [[Phoebe’s Whamburger]]  
and Louie’s Place.

Who would be him, [[gorilla with a nightstick]],  
whose home is a place  
[[he might, this time, never get back to?]]

And who would be who have to be  
[[his victims?]]

[[Norman MacCaig]] [[Brooklyn Cop]]
