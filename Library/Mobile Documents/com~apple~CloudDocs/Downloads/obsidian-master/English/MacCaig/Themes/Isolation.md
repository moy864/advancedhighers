# Isolation
```ad-aj
Aunt Julia was isolated due to the communication barrier that existed between her nephew and her old-fashioned ways. She is also dead which isolates her from time.
- [[Aunt Julia spoke Gaelic]]
- [[I could not answer her —]]
- [[wore men’s boots]]
- [[with so many questions]]
- [[unanswered]]
- [[getting angry, getting angry]]
```

```ad-as
In 'Assisi', the dwarf is isolated from the help of the priest, tourists and society in general. This [[contrasts]] with the persona of St. Francis who devoted his life to helping others, especially those cast aside by society. THis therefore empahsieses one of the key themes of the poem: the hypocrisy of the church.
- "It was those who passsed the [[ruined temple]] outside"
- The beggar is described as being "outside the [[three tiers of churches built]] in honour of St. Francis"

```ad-vs

- [[Ward 7.]]
