# Basking Shark
[[To stub]] an oar on a rock where none should be,  
To have it rise with a [[slounge]] out of the sea  
Is a [[thing]] that happened once [[(too often)]] to me.

[[But not too often – though enough.]] I count as gain  
That once I met, on a sea [[tin-tacked]] with rain,  
That [[roomsized monster]] with a [[matchbox brain]].

[[He displaced more than water]]. He [[shoggled]] me  
Centuries back – this [[decadent townee]]  
[[Shook on a wrong branch of his family tree.]]

Swish up the dirt and, when it settles, a spring  
Is all the clearer. I saw me, in one fling,  
Emerging from the slime of everything.

So who’s the monster? The thought made me grow pale  
For twenty seconds while, sail after sail,  
The tall fin slid away and then the tail.
