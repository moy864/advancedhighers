# Assisi 
The dwarf with his [[Hands on backwards]]  
[[sat, slumped like a half-filled sack]]
[[tiny, twisted legs]] from which  
[[sawdust]] might run,  
outside the [[three tiers of churches built]]
in honour of St Francis, brother  
[[of the poor, talker with birds]], over whom  
he had the advantage  
of [[not being dead yet]]

A priest explained  
[[how clever it was of Giotto]]  
to make his frescoes tell stories  
that would reveal to the illiterate the [[goodness]]  
of God and the [[English/quotes/suffering]] 
of His Son. [[I understood]] 
the explanation and  
the cleverness.

A [[rush of tourists, clucking contentedly]],  
[[fluttered]] after him as he scattered  
the [[grain of the Word]]. It was they who had passed  
the [[ruined temple]] outside, whose eyes  
[[wept pus]], whose back was higher  
than his head, whose lopsided mouth  
said Grazie in a voice as sweet  
[[as a child’s when she speaks to her mother]]  
or a bird’s when it spoke  
to [[St Francis]].

```ad-key
Stanza 1: Initially, the focus of the poem is the beggar who sits on the steps of the Basilica. The imagery is almost grotesque and emphasises the terrible condition of the man. Sibilance creates an incredibly vivid picture of him sugesting that he can barely support himself. Then, the sack metaphor is continued to suggest that he is merely a deformed shell of a human filled with stuffing
